# HIV-PrEP-Simulation

This Python code simulates an HIV infectious process, with a variety of TasP and PrEP treatment regimes.  The only required input parameter is the index of the simulation being performed, allowing for parallel simulations.  The output is a .csv with the outcome, TasP, and PrEP person-years, as well as a variety of personal and cluster features.
